The meeting on 19th August was great and I would like to share some info about it.
​
After 3 years of inactivity, Pyladies Munich is back!
About the meetup yesterday,

​Around 54 ladies from different fields who work professionally with coding or are learning to program attended the meeting of Pyladies Munich revival
Around 20% of the ladies want to contribute by sharing their work and becoming a speaker
The leaders from other meetup were also there to share their experience and to organize better events in the future for the Python community, including the PyMunich organizers Anton Caceres and Dibya Chakravorty
We were happy to raffle two tickets for the PyCon DE & PyData Berlin; the winners were super happy and Pyladies Munich will go with them for the event.
 Auke, a Senior Python Engineer and an Open Source Maintainer from The Mobility House shared some interesting points about Data Classes and Pep8 (Best Practices of Software Development) https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
Franziska Schropp, from Alexander Thamm she shared her enthusiastic path from a beginner perspective and motivated others to start to learn Python.
Stay tuned for the next meetup in September.
